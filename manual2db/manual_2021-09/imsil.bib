In this work, we present a comprehensive comparison between BCA and MD for Si ions impinging on a (001)-Si surface by comparing “channeling maps”, i.e., projected ranges of the ions as a function of incidence direction in a representative part of the angular space. We find quantitative differences to develop as the energy decreases below ∼100 eV, but find qualitative agreement down to ∼10 eV. Moreover, the quality of the BCA channeling maps depends on the implementation of the BCA, which is explained in terms of double-hits and missed collisions.},

	abstract = {Atom redistribution is an important mechanism of ion bombardment induced spontaneous pattern formation in amorphous or amorphized targets. It may be characterized by either molecular dynamics (MD) simulations or by Monte Carlo (MC) simulations based on the binary collision approximation (BCA). In this work we analyze problems of the BCA approach in predicting atom redistribution by comparing MC and MD simulations of recoil events in amorphized Si. We find that the MC results critically depend on the displacement energy used, on the choice of the free flight paths and maximum impact parameters, and on the construction of the trajectories. Moreover, the net atom redistribution as determined by MD is significantly larger for recoils starting near the surface than for bulk recoils. The effect is not reproduced by the MC simulations.},

	abstract = {A theoretical study of forward and backward sputtering produced by the impact of single 20 keV Ar ions on freestanding amorphous Si membranes is carried out. We use three techniques: Monte Carlo (MC) and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, as well as analytical theory based on the Sigmund model of sputtering. We find that the analytical model provides a fair description of the simulation results if the film thickness d exceeds about 10\%–30\% of the mean depth of energy deposition a. In this regime, backward sputtering is nearly independent of the membrane thickness and forward sputtering shows a maximum for thicknesses d≈a. The dependence of forward sputtering on the ion\&apos;s incidence angle shows a qualitative change as a function of d: while for d≲a, the forward sputter yield has a maximum at oblique incidence angles, the maximum occurs at normal incidence for d≳a. As the membrane thickness is reduced below 0.1–0.3a, the theory\&apos;s predictions increasingly deviate from the MC results. For example, the predicted forward sputter yield approaches a finite value but the MC result tends to zero. This behavior is interpreted in terms of energy deposition and sputtering efficiency. Near-perfect agreement is observed between the sputter yields calculated by MD and MC simulations even for the thinnest membranes studied (d = 5 Å).},

It is concluded that the dominant factor at glancing angles is surface roughness. Two roughness models, sinusoidal and pink noise, are used to demonstrate that very small amplitude (∼2 Å) roughness is required to obtain quantitative agreement with experiments at very glancing angles.

In this work I discuss the limitations of these models, including a generalized model containing the isotropic and planar models as special cases, by comparing molecular dynamics (MD) and binary collision (BC) simulations of atom ejection from (1 0 0)-Si surfaces. It is shown that a surface potential close to planar best describes the MD results. However, in the BC simulations (i) emission yields are systematically too high at low ejection energies, (ii) discrepancies with respect to MD are larger for the ejection of atoms from sub-surface layers, and (iii) the emission yield for top-layer atoms does not increase during erosion of the top layer as suggested by MD. Possible reasons for these deficiencies are discussed. It is concluded that BC results are seriously in question when the effect under investigation depends on the fate of low-energy recoils at the surface.},

In this work the roles of redeposition and second-order sputtering are investigated using a segment-based model in two dimensions. Angular distributions and yields for sputtering and backscattering are extracted from Monte–Carlo simulations. Deep trenches exhibiting microtrenching are simulated. It is found that redeposition leads to inclined sidewalls and a bending up of the bottom towards the sidewalls, while secondary sputtering causes the formation of a pair of microtrenches that increase in size until they meet in the center of the trench. Redeposition leads to a reduction of the effective milling rate, while secondary sputtering may increase it, particularly once the two microtrenches have met. A scaling rule is shown to apply to our simulations, which reduces the number of parameters the observed profile shape depends on. In addition, results are presented of flux calculations on experimentally obtained ripple profiles, suggesting that redeposition and backscattering may play a role in late stage ripple development.},

	abstract = {FIB technologies possess a unique ability to form topographies that are difficult or impossible to generate with binary etching through typical photo-lithography. The ability to arbitrarily vary the spatial dose distribution and therefore the amount of milling opens possibilities for the production of a wide range of functional structures with applications in biology, chemistry, and optics. However in practice, the realization of these goals is made difficult by the angular dependence of the sputtering yield and redeposition effects that vary as the topography evolves. An inverse modeling algorithm that optimizes dose profiles, defined as the superposition of time invariant pixel dose profiles (determined from the beam parameters and pixel dwell times), is presented. The response of the target to a set of pixel dwell times in modeled by numerical continuum simulations utilizing 1st and 2nd order sputtering and redeposition, the resulting surfaces are evaluated with respect to a target topography in an error minimization routine. Two algorithms for the parameterization of pixel dwell times are presented, a direct pixel dwell time method, and an abstracted method that uses a refineable piecewise linear cage function to generate pixel dwell times from a minimal number of parameters. The cage function method demonstrates great flexibility and efficiency as compared to the direct fitting method with performance enhancements exceeding ∼10× as compared to direct fitting for medium to large simulation sets. Furthermore, the refineable nature of the cage function enables solutions to adapt to the desired target function. The optimization algorithm, although working with stationary dose profiles, is demonstrated to be applicable also outside the quasi-static approximation. Experimental data confirms the viability of the solutions for 5 × 7 μm deep lens like structures defined by 90 pixel dwell times.},

In this work, we propose a simple one-parameter model (the “density gradient model”) which imitates surface roughness effects. In the model, the target’s atomic density is assumed to vary linearly between the actual material density and zero. The layer width is the sole model parameter. The model has been implemented in the binary collision simulator IMSIL and has been evaluated against various geometric surface models for 5 keV Ga ions impinging an amorphous Si target. To aid the construction of a realistic rough surface topography, we have performed MD simulations of sequential 5 keV Ga impacts on an initially crystalline Si target. We show that our new model effectively reproduces the sputtering yield, with only minor variations in the energy and angular distributions of sputtered particles. The success of the density gradient model is attributed to a reduction of the reflection coefficient – leading to increased sputtering yields, similar in effect to surface roughness.},

	abstract = {Sigmund's model of spatially resolved sputtering is the underpinning of many models of nanoscale pattern formation induced by ion bombardment. It is based on three assumptions: (i) the number of sputtered atoms is proportional to the nuclear energy deposition (NED) near the surface, (ii) the NED distribution is independent of the orientation and shape of the solid surface and is identical to the one in an infinite medium, and (iii) the NED distribution in an infinite medium can be approximated by a Gaussian. We test the validity of these assumptions using Monte Carlo simulations of He, Ar, and Xe impacts on Si at energies of 2, 20, and 200 keV with incidence angles from perpendicular to grazing. We find that for the more commonly-employed beam parameters (Ar and Xe ions at 2 and 20 keV and nongrazing incidence), the Sigmund model's predictions are within a factor of 2 of the Monte Carlo results for the total sputter yield and the first two moments of the spatially resolved sputter yield. This is partly due to a compensation of errors introduced by assumptions (i) and (ii). The Sigmund model, however, does not describe the skewness of the spatially resolved sputter yield, which is almost always significant. The approximation is much poorer for He ions and/or high energies (200 keV). All three of Sigmund's assumptions break down at grazing incidence angles. In all cases, we discuss the origin of the deviations from Sigmund's model.},

	abstract = {Transient enhanced diffusion of dopants in silicon is frequently modeled using the “+1” approximation of implantation damage. Using a more realistic model predicts somewhat more transient diffusion than the +1 model. For many purposes, the +1 model can be improved by a simple scaling factor, which we call the effective plus factor. In this work we study the dose, energy, and ion species dependence of the effective plus factor. The simulation model is based on binary collision simulations to obtain point defect concentrations after ion implantation and a continuum model that includes the effect of spatial correlations of the defects to describe diffusion and recombination. This approach is shown to agree well with atomistic simulations. Results are presented in the energy range of 1 keV to 1 MeV, for doses between 0 and and the ion species B, Si, P, and As. In the high‐dose limit deviations from the +1 model are considerable for heavy ions and/or low energies with a maximum of approximately 4 for 1 keV As. The plus factor also increases with decreasing dose. However, the increase is not significant for doses above and only moderate (less than a factor of two) for doses above . The results agree with transient enhanced diffusion data over a range of energies and doses, with some anomalous exceptions at very low dose. © 2000 The Electrochemical Society.

The MD mode takes only ion-target atom interactions into account, and considers lattice vibrations and electronic stopping in the same way as the BC mode. Good agreement is found between predictions of the new MD code and the results of recent round robin simulations for 200 eV B in Si. This is also true for the BC simulations if the time integral is taken into account in the calculation of the turning points of the trajectories. In contrast to common belief, it is not necessary to use a special treatment of “simultaneous collisions”. Simulations of B implantations into Si parallel to the [110] or [100] direction or tilted by 9° with respect to the [100] direction show that the binary collision approximation may be used at least down to implantation energies of 200 eV and that the errors are still moderate at 50 eV. Moreover, it is found that profiles of B implanted near the [100] direction do not depend on the tilt angle around 200 eV and below.},

	abstract = {Spontaneous pattern formation by energetic ion beams is usually explained in terms of surface-curvature dependent sputtering and atom redistribution in the target. Recently, the effect of ion implantation on surface stability has been studied for nonvolatile ion species, but for the case of noble gas ion beams it has always been assumed that the implanted atoms can be neglected. In this work, we show by molecular dynamics (MD) and Monte Carlo (MC) simulations that this assumption is not valid in a wide range of implant conditions. Sequential-impact MD simulations are performed for 1-keV Ar, 2-keV Kr, and 2-keV Xe bombardments of Si, starting with a pure single-crystalline Si target and running impacts until sputtering equilibrium has been reached. The simulations demonstrate the importance of the implanted ions for crater-function estimates. The atomic volumes of Ar, Kr, and Xe in Si are found to be a factor of two larger than in the solid state. To extend the study to a wider range of energies, MC simulations are performed. We find that the role of the implanted ions increases with the ion energy although the increase is attenuated for the heavier ions. The analysis uses the crater function formalism specialized to the case of sputtering equilibrium.},

Here we explore to what extent this effect is modified for alloy targets using both Monte Carlo and molecular dynamics simulations. For the exemplary case of amorphous SicGe1−c spheres, we find that, in the limit of small curvatures, the curvature dependence of the sputter preferentiality is negligible. This finding can be explained by a natural extension of the existing analytical theory of curvature-dependent sputtering for elemental materials. For large curvatures, however, the sputter preferentiality strongly depends on curvature. In this case, molecular-dynamics simulations also predict strong spike effects which increase the sputter yields. Sputter yield amplification—an increase in partial sputter yield with decreasing concentration of the element—occurs for Si-rich alloys.},

tation in channeling directions provides more abrupt profiles

random implants. Channeling along [1120] has a clear advantage
over [0001] and [1123], both in terms of less lateral penetration
and lower sensitivity to implant damage and beam divergence.

It combines atomistic binary collision simulation with continuum mechanics. The only parameters that enter the continuum model are the bulk modulus and the radiation-induced viscosity. The shear modulus can also be considered but shows only minor effects. A boundary-fitted grid is proposed that is usable both during the binary collision simulation and for the spatial discretization of the force balance equations. As an application, the milling of a slit into an amorphous silicon membrane with a 30 keV focused Ga beam is studied, which demonstrates the relevance of the new model compared to a more heuristic approach used in previous work.},
