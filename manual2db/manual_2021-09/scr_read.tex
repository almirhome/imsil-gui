The \texttt{read\_output.py} file may be used as a module to access the IMSILoutput data from a Python 3 script. In addition, \texttt{read\_output.py} may beused as a script with simple plotting functionality. To use functions of \texttt{read\_output.py} in your own Python script, you mustimport \texttt{read\_output} as a module. E.g., to read and plot data from\texttt{example.his}, you can write%\begin{verbatim}    import sys    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt    sys.path.insert(0, <path-to-scripts>)    from read_output import read_his    x, c = read_his('example.his')    plt.plot(x, c)    plt.show()\end{verbatim}%Here, \texttt{<path-to-scripts>} denotes the path to the directory where\texttt{read\_output.py} resides.The following functions are defined in \texttt{read\_output.py}:\bigskip%\begin{center}\begin{tabular}{|l|p{0.65\textwidth}|}\hlineFunction           & Purpose \\\hline\tt read\_par      & Read the file names (without extension) defined in a                     parameters file. Optionally, also return the value of one                     parameter for each file name. \\\tt read\_inp      & Read the value of a parameter from an input (\texttt{.inp})                     file. \\\tt read\_out      & Read a value from an output data table in the output                     (\texttt{.out}) file. \\\tt extract\_yield & Read the sputter yield from the output (\texttt{.out})                     file. \\\tt read\_his      & Read a 1-D histogram file (\texttt{.his} and other files                     described in Section~\ref{s:his1d}). \\\tt read\_his2     & Read a 2-D histogram file (\texttt{.his2} and other files                     described in Section~\ref{s:his2d}). \\\tt read\_his3     & Read a 3-D histogram file (\texttt{.his3} and other files                     described in Section~\ref{s:his3d}). \\\tt read\_trajectories & Read a trajectory \texttt{.tra.} file. The return value                     is a list of cascades, where each cascade is a list of                     trajectories, where each trajectory is a list of collision                     points. \\\hline\end{tabular}\end{center}\bigskipFor a detailed description of the function arguments and return values see thecode.\texttt{read\_output.py} may also be called as a script such as%\begin{verbatim}    <path-to-read_output.py> example.his\end{verbatim}%This has very limited functionality, though. The code in the main function of\texttt{read\_output.py} is mainly intended to provide a template for callingthe functions in your own script.
