In this chapter an overview of the physical models implemented in IMSIL 
is given. More details are found in the references listed at the end of
this manual. A particular objective of this chapter is to give 
correspondence lists of the notation of the most important model 
parameters as used in this chapter or in the references and the names of 
the variables as they have to be specified in the input file. The complete 
information about all input parameters is found in Chapter~\ref{k:input}.
